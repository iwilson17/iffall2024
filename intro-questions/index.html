        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>Here are the answers to get to know me</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hi, my name is Isa Wilson. I'm a sophomore majoring in Communication Design with a minor in Human Computer Interaction.</li>

            <li>I have a passion for UX design and want to continue to expand my knowledge of UI/UX through this course. Already, I've done website design for a nonprofit as well as small companies and have taken many UX workshops. In addition, I am one of the exec members on a UI/UX club on campus.</li>
        
            <li>I am currently taking a class to learn Java at WashU.</li>

            <li>I hope to learn more about the developer's side of a website design.</li>

            <li>I expect designing on the screen to require more logic compared to creative thought.</li>

            <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/search">Visit Spotify's Website</a> - I selected Spotify because the consistent grid like structure and color palette allows the site to be easy to navigated with limited distractions and makes the brand easily recognized.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">Visit Duolingo's Website</a> - I selected Duolingo because the easy to understand phrases in the pop-ups, rounded corners throughout the website, and the overall gamified way to learn a language creates a fun, inviting tone to the website that attracts user attention.</li>
            
            <li><a href="https://girlswhocode.com">Visit GirlsWhoCode's Website</a> - I selected Girls Who Code because the website has variety in the way they organize their content with various column structures while still maintaining alignment, creating more visual interest through its complexity.</li>
