            <h4>Learn how the game was created</h4>
            <p>Mario Kart Wii's is the sixth game in the Mario Kart Series created by general producer, Shigeru Miyamoto, along with Hideki Konno, who worked with the Software Development Department at Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD).</p>
            <p>The game was the first in the series to feature BMX motorbikes as drivable vehicles, an idea which Konno had proposed since Double Dash out of his passion for extreme sports but was rejected due to the seemingly bizarre image of Mario riding a bike. The game was briefly known internally under the name "Mario Kart X" before its final name was decided upon, referring to the "X" in the word "extreme".</p>
            <p>To complement Mario Kart Wii's unique motion controls, a plastic, wheel-shaped casing for the Wii Remote was included with some versions of the game. The designers tested roughly 30 different prototypes of the wheel with different shapes, colors, and weights based on real-life go-karts. </p>
